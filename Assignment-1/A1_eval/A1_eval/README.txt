Steps to evaluate

1. Place your submission (tar.gz) in [~/A1_eval/compilerLab/submissions].
2. Execute [bash run_me.sh] from the same directory.
3. Wait for reports to be generated in .html.
4. Directory [~/A1_eval/compilerLab/submissions/reports_eval] will contain the <rollno>.html files.
5. File [eval2.csv] under current directory will be the marksheet (partial marking taken into consideration).

partial marking scheme
----------------------
(i) [test-case passed] for parsing success: +(1/7) for each component that matches with expected output.
(ii) [test-case passes] other successes: +1 if matches with expected output.
(iii) [test-case failed] +0 if does not match with expected output.
